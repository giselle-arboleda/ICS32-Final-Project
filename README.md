FUNCTIONALITY

When you open the DSU Messenger, you must first load a file. Do this by clicking "File/Settings" 
in the top left then selecting either the "New" or "Open..." options.
The "New" selection will prompt you to create a new .dsu file, while the "Open..." selection will open a prexisting one.

Next, you will need to select a user to start messaging with.
If you do not have any users loaded already, go to "File/Settings" then select "Add User"
You will be prompted to input the username of the user you would like to chat with. Do so and hit the "Insert" button.

All of your loaded users will be visible in the list of usernames on the left of the messenger.
In order to chat with a user, click on their name in the list of usernames.
A log of messages sent and received from this user are visible in the chat log (toprightmost textbox).
Directly below the log of messages is the text input.
Type up what you want to send into the text input, then hit the "Send" button to directly message your selected user.

When you are done using the DSU Messenger, select "Close" from the "File/Settings" dropdown to close the program.

Additionally, the "File/Settings" dropdown has "Christmas Mode On" and "Christmas Mode Off" buttons.
Click them for jolly good fun!

The status bar on the bottom left corner of screen will provide information on how to go through the messaging process,
as well as if the DSU Messenger is currently busy updating.
