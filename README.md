FUNCTIONALITY

Before you can send messages to anybody, you will need to add a User you would like to chat with.
You can achieve this by pressing the "Add User" button, which is positioned in the bottomleft of the screen.
A popup will appear, prompting you to enter to the username of the user you would like to chat with.
Do so and hit enter. A direct message with this user will appear in the textbox above the "Add User" button.

This leftmost textbox is your recent messages list. Posts sent and recieved by you can be seen here.
In order to chat with this user, click on their name in the recent messages list.
The toprightmost textbox is the chat log.
A log of direct messages sent by and to the current selected user is here.

Directly below that is the text input. Type up what you want to send into the box, then hit the "Send" button
(located below the text input on the bottom right of the screen) to send your message to the currently selected user.

A status bar on the bottom of screen provides information on what the GUI is currently processing.
